# QGSS_24
This repository consists of my solutions to Jupyter notebooks of Qiskit Global Summer School (QGSS) 2024. 

The QGSS was a two-week intensive summer program designed to empower the quantum researchers and developers of tomorrow with the know-how to explore the world of quantum computing, as well as refresh and sharpen the industry professionalâ€™s skills. This fifth-annual summer school prepared participants for the imminent era of quantum utility. Using hands on examples, the syllabi will guide students through areas of near-term practical importance.
